This is libsolv, a free package dependency solver using a satisfyability
algorihtm.

This code is based on two major, but independent, blocks:

1. Using a dictionary approach to store and retrieve package
   and dependency information.
   
2. Using satisfiability, a well known and researched topic, for
   resolving package dependencies.

Google for 'sat solver' to get links to the theory behind it.

Requires: cmake 2.4.x

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

To create a package:
make srcpackage
see package/
